    <p style="color: #AAA"> Users of this site are those who want to know information about a manga listed on the MAL site. <br />
        The expected usefulness of this site is to grant the user the ability to quickly search up a manga they're interested in. <br />
        I want to make this site similar to AniList and MyAnimeList, but with more minimalization/simplification. <br />
        The goal is to have users browse the titles they want to see, filter by genre, popularity, etc. By default they are listed from highest rated. </p>
