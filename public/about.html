    <h1 style="color: #AAA">Section 1</h1><p style="color: #AAA">I'm Michael McClure. I am a senior and computer science major at Georgia State University. I plan to graduate in the spring, and have been looking for SWE roles in hopes of having a job offer before I graduate.<br />
    <h1 style="color: #AAA">Section 2</h1><p style="color: #AAA">This project is a manga database application that allows users to browse the manga on MAL using the Jikan API. I chose this project as a personal website for browsing and favoriting manga.<br />
    <h1 style="color: #AAA">Section 3</h1><p style="color: #AAA">The techstack I used was HTML, CSS, ReactJS, Wordpress, and PHP. I used phpMyAdmin for my database.<br />
    <h1 style="color: #AAA">Section 4</h1><p style="color: #AAA">During this course, I learned WordPress, PHP, phpMyAdmin, WinSCP, and AWS. I also learned non-tech stuff, such as medidation, stress-control, networking, etc. This class has been a great help and I will continue to apply things I learned during this class even after this course is over. This project was good at helping me stay focused during trial and error. I was having deployment issues, so I put in many hours of researching on how to host a ReactJS app that uses PHP for the login.<br />
